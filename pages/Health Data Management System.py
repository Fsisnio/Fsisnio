The pie chart provides a visual representation of the distribution of different data management systems used across hospitals. Each slice of the pie indicates the proportion of hospitals utilizing a specific system, showcasing the diversity and prevalence of various solutions in the healthcare industry. This graphical tool aids in quickly identifying the most commonly adopted systems, as well as those that are less widespread. By analyzing the pie chart, stakeholders can gain insights into current trends in hospital data management practices, enabling informed decisions regarding technology adoption and integration for improved patient care and operational efficiency.
